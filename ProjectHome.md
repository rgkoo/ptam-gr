This is my summer project in my senior year. This project, which is originated in DA lab, SJTU, combines the edge-cutting technology of PTAM(parallel tracking and mapping) with gesture recognition and identification. PTAM construct the world map points for augmented reality display, while gesture recognition provides a powerful way for user input.
